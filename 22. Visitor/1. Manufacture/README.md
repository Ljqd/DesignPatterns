# Problem
We consider an enterprise with different types of employees (salesperson, manager, etc.), each of whom receives a salary. There is also a class that unites all employees of the organization and reports the total amount of expenses that the organization has to pay as salaries.

Implement the Visitor design template by adding the ability to change the salary for employees in the following ways

increase salaries by a specified percentage;
impose fines on employees.
After that, add a new type of employee to the simulation, for example, an IT support worker, and extend the support of the implemented Visitor template to it.
