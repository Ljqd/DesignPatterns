# Problem: Decorating a string

Let's consider the PrintableString class, which is a container for a field of type string and contains a single public method for displaying this string to the console.

For this class, describe a set of decorators:

- **PostComaDecorator** - a decorator for adding a comma to the end of a string.
- **PostEndlDecorator** - a decorator for adding a newline character to the end of a line.
- **PostSpaceDecorator** - decorator for adding a space character to the end of a line.
- **PostExclaimDecorator** - decorator for adding an exclamation mark to the end of a line.
- **PostWordDecorator** - decorator for adding a word to the end of a line.
- **PreWordDecorator** - a decorator for adding a word to the beginning of a line.

Using this set of decorators, print the following expression to the console

> Hello, World!

expression, starting with an empty base line.
