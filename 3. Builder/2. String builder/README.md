# Problem: StringBuilder
Implement the Builder template to form a string.

Provide methods for appending a sequence of characters to the end and inserting a sequence of characters at a specified position.

> Forget for a minute that C++ std::string has more than sufficient append() and insert() methods. Even that it has STD "string" at all.
