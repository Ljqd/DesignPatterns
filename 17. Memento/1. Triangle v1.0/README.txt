# Problem
Consider the Triangle class, which contains three fields that determine the lengths of the sides of this triangle.

For the Triangle, operations for changing its sides are defined, which check whether the triangle will exist after such an operation.

In addition, operations for calculating the area and perimeter are defined for this triangle.

Implement the Snapshot design template to store the history of changes to the triangle's sides and restore the triangle to the state where the triangle had the largest area.

Implement all three ways to implement the Snapshot design pattern:

- based on inner classes;
- implementation with an empty interface;
- with increased security.
