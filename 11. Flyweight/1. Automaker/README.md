# Problem
Most cars consist of a large number of parts such as the engine, wheels, steering wheel, etc. During the assembly of a car, standard parts are installed in it, which are repeated in many modifications. Accordingly, by programming a game or simulator that uses similar class hierarchies, you can significantly save memory and reduce the time of creating objects of the Car class if you cache the same parts. Below is a simple hierarchy for such a simulator.
